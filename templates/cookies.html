                provide information to the website owners.

            <p>
                We use the following third-party services that may set cookies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bootstrap CDN:</strong> For loading CSS and JavaScript frameworks. 
                    These are necessary for the application's user interface.</li>

                    the interface.</li>

                These third-party services have their own privacy policies and cookie practices. 
                We recommend reviewing their policies.
            </p>
            
            <h3>5. Managing Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can:

            <ul>

                <li>Block cookies from being set in the future</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Disabling essential cookies may prevent the application 
                from functioning correctly, particularly the login and session management features.
            </p>
